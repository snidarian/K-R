/*
This file satisfies two requirements. It is a useful Exercise (2-1) in the K&R and It is a field reference for the capabilities for limits.h 
Exercise 2-1. Write a program to determine the ranges of char , short , int , and long
variables, both signed and unsigned , by printing appropriate values from standard headers
and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various
floating-point types.
